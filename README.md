# README

This Braintree API integration example uses Ruby on Rails. 

To begin, include in your Gemfile:

gem 'braintree'

and then send the command:

bundle install

Once you have set up your Braintree sandbox account and obtained your sandbox keys, you can store them in the environment.rb page in your Rails application.
